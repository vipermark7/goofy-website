A goof around website to practice web dev

So far, we have a React frontend, and plan to use Express and Mongo for the backend

To install, clone the app onto your system and type in `npm install` in the cloned folder at your terminal in both the frontend and the backend folders

Then, to start the dev server (only on certain branches), run 'npm start' - it will automatically run on on localhost:3000. The server will automagically update with your changes when you save a file :)
